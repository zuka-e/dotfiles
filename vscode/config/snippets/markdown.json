  // Place your snippets for markdown here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Accordion": {
    "prefix": "disclosure",
    "body": [
      "<details>",
      "<summary style=\"cursor: pointer;\">$1</summary>",
      "",
      "$2",
      "",
      "</details>"
    ],
    "description": "Create an accordion block"
  },
  "AccordionCodeblockForQiita": {
    "prefix": "disclosure containing codeblock for Qiita",
    "body": [
      "<details><summary>$1</summary><div>",
      "",
      "```$2",
      "$3",
      "```",
      "</details></div>"
    ],
    "description": "Create an accordion block for qiita"
